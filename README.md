# MFE-FCGCN-model
The repository is for the code and data of the MFE-FCGCN model.

The dataset is sourced from the paper 'A Dataset of Scalp EEG Recordings of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Healthy Subjects from Routine EEG'. The dataset can be downloaded from the following URL: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.8.The raw dataset can be downloaded from the website, so it will not be uploaded here.

This code consists of three parts: the raw_data_processing section calculates PSD features and two types of functional connectivity relationships from the raw EEG dataset files; the generate_graph_data section converts the extracted data into graph data format and saves it; the model_and_train section includes the model architecture and training procedure. The main Python libraries used are PyTorch and PYG, and the Python version used is 3.11.
